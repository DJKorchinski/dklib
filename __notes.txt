Some notes on adding dklib as a submodule to a git project:
git submodule add https://github.com/DJKorchinski/dklib.git
I wrote the above command into a little script ',git_dklib.sh' in my ~/scripts folder. Might be useful!


Some notes on the future devlopment of the library:
- There are are a bunch of utilities that ended up in the plothelp file, and some of these should probably be split into separate code files.
    - mostly related to averaging over bins, estimating summary stats on histograms, etc. 
- should we add our linux cheat sheet to the dklib? Might be handy to have it available in my projects.



Some notes on initial set up of the git folder:
git remote add origin https://github.com/DJKorchinski/dklib.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
